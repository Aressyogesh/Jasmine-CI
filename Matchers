What is a matcher ?
- It is just a function which implement a boolean comparison between the 
  actual value and the expected value.

expect(/*Actual Value*/).toBe(/*Expected Value*/);

A matcher is responsible for reporting to jasmine if the expectation is true or false. -> passing
or failing spec.
